/*
  A TodoList collection is used to group our models. 
  The collection uses the LocalStorage adapter to override Backbone’s default sync() operation 
  with one that will persist our Todo records to HTML5 Local Storage. 
  Through local storage, they’re saved between page requests.

  The collection’s completed() and remaining() methods return an array of finished and 
  unfinished todos, respectively.

  The nextOrder() method implements a sequence generator while a comparator() sorts items 
  by their insertion order.
